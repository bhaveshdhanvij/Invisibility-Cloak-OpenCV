# Invisibility Cloak Project

## Overview
This project creates a real-time **invisibility cloak effect** using Python and OpenCV. By detecting a specific color (default: red) in a live webcam feed and replacing it with a pre-captured background, the project gives the illusion of invisibility. It is inspired by the concept of the “Harry Potter Cloak of Invisibility” and demonstrates practical computer vision techniques.

- Real-time webcam video processing  
- Detects a target color (default red) and hides it using background replacement  
- Robust mask handling using morphological operations to reduce noise  
- Optional video recording of the invisibility effect  
- Easy to use and interactive
